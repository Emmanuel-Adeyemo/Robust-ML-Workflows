# Robust-ML-Workflows
This repository is a systematic exploration of predictive modeling, moving from foundational linear techniques to high-performance ensemble methods.

01. Regularized Regression and Variance Control:  
Goal: Address heteroscedasticity and stabilize high-dimensional polynomial models.  
Key Techniques: Yeo-Johnson Transformations, Polynomial Interaction Features, Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net.  
Highlight: Implementation of the 1-SE Rule to select conservative hyperparameters that prevent overfitting in polynomial space.  
Status: Completed (Test $MAE$: 9.18, Test $R^2$: 0.56, OOB $R^2$: 0.53).

02. Tree models and ensembles:
   Status: In progress
